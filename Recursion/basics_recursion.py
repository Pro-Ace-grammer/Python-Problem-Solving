'''
Recursion is basically a function calling itself again and again several number of times until the base condition is reached.

Key Points about Recursion:
Base Case: Every recursive function needs a base case that will stop the recursion. Without it, the function will call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.

Recursive Case: This is where the function calls itself with a modified argument, gradually moving towards the base case.

# print(facto(5))
